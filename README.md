# 📝 Quick Start

- Install [node](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download) (download the `zip` file and execute the `.exe`).
- Open your `terminal` (as administrator if necessary)
- Use `nvm install 16` and after the installation, use `nvm use 16`.
- Go to the project folder and run `npm run generate`, then `npm start`.

Now you can access `http://localhost:3000/`. There are 3 endpoints:

- /categories -> get all categories
- /categories/{category} -> get specific category
- /categories/search/{query} -> search for specific category
